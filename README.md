# Android examples
In this repository, I will load some code snippets from the Android world, in order to let you dive into interesting solutions.

Uploaded example:
  - [GPS tracker](https://github.com/andreamontanari/android/blob/master/GPSTracker.java) service
  - Android M (Marshmallow) [dangerous permission request](https://github.com/andreamontanari/android/blob/master/SplashScreenActivity.java)
  - ...


### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Java] - One of the most used programming languages!
* [Android] - mobile platform
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Dillinger.io] -Markdown online free editor



### Use and download

You can clone the repository on your local machine:

```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url] andreamontanari-examples
$ cd andreamontanari-examples
